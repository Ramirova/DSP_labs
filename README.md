My implementations of Labs on Digital Signal Processing course. 

1. Solution of ODE using Euler's and Runge-Kutta's method
2. Echo generation/cancellation using autocorrelation; Chorus generation; Implementation of Standard deviation, Covariance and Correlation; Speech recognition.
3. Convolution reverb. Experiment with room imupse response recordong.
4. My implementation of Discrete Fourier transform and Fast Fourier transform functions compared to built-in fft() function.
5.  DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) generating and decoding.
